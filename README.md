# Some Study Concepts

This is solely for me to practice various things using React and other various items of interest.

Working on making Navbar set to left side of page (wiki style). 
    - Currently working on building routes.
    - Built base routes to automatically generate depending on the array list within App.js.  Need to stylize so that all structures are not hidden by the sidebar.
    - Dynamic Navbar built.

After set, would like to incorporate redux to handle state.  My idea is to have each practiced component build out the navbar.
