# Some Study Concepts

This is solely for me to practice various things using React and other various items of interest.

Working on making Navbar set to left side of page (wiki style).  
    - Components are building through the full page.  Working trhough SaSS to update minor styling.  Setting up functioning variables.
    - Will like to build a base styling for each component.
    - Dynamic Navbar built.

After set, would like to incorporate redux to handle state.  My idea is to have each practiced component build out the navbar.
